# MidTerm

## Library
For the midterm you will design a library tracking system.  There are several requirements your system must fulfil.
1.	We have different types of media.  Some examples are DVDs, Blu-ray, books, magazines, newspapers, reference books, etc.
2.	All media is categorized by one topics and subtopics.
3.	Users should be able to search for books by ISBN, topic or a fuzzy search on title.
4.	Users should also be able to see who has checked a book out in the past.
5.	When a book is checked out a due date should apply and one dollar per day should be fined for every day overdue.
6.	Users should be able to see a picture of the book if available.
7.	Users should have a cart of their currently checked out books and an admin should be able to assign books or return (remove assignment).

### Deliverables
1. A git repository with all of your django code and setup files. Make this a new repository under your user.  https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/  Include a docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile so I can run your project similar to our existing one.
